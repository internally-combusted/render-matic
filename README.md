# Render-Matic 9000

![renderer screen capture](https://github.com/internally-combusted/render-matic/blob/master/renderer%20output%20example.png?raw=true)

A renderer I've written using [`gfx_hal`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx), a cross-platform library for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) that more or less wraps the [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) API for low-level graphics programming. 

This is not at all a polished, professional-grade effort, but a toy project for attempting to simultaneously learn Rust and graphics programming. It's been very educational, but I'm still nowhere close to mastering either of the two!
